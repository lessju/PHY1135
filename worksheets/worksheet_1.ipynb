    "The Newton-Raphson method iteration is a popular means of finding roots of equations of the form $f(x) = 0$. It is based on the simple geometrical notion that if a crude estimation of $x_0$ of the solution is known, then an improved estimate $x_1$ can be found using the slope $f'x_0$ as in the figure below. From this diagram, the slope of the tangent at $x_0$ can be found as\n",

The program should allow the user to enter the value of $c$ whose root needs to be found, and a guess $x_0$. In each subsequent run of the program, enter the previous approximation to get a better estimate. Find the value of $\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{10}$ and $\\sqrt{4096}$ in this way.\n",
