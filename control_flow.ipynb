    "In the programs we have seen till now, there has always been a series of statements faithfully executed by Python in exact top-down order. What if you wanted to change the flow of how it works? For example, you want the program to take some decisions and do different things on different situations, such as printing 'Good Morning' or 'Good Evening' depending on the time of the day? This is achieved using control flow statements. There are three control flow statements in Python - `if`, `for` and `while`\n",

What we do here is supply two numbers and `range` returns a sequence of numbers starting from the first number and up to the second number. For example, `range(1, 5)` gives the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. By default, `range` take a step count of 1. If we supply a third number to `range`, then that becomes the step count. For example, `range(1, 5, 2)` gives `[1, 3]`. Remember that the range extends *up to* the second number, that is it does **not** include the second number. So if the first number is x and second number is y, the sequence is $\\{i\\mid x,y,i\\;∈\\;ℕ\\;and\\;i\\;>=\\;x\\;and\\;i\\;<\\;y\\}$.\n",
