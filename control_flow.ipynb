For example, you want the program to take some decisions and do different things on different situations, such as printing 'Good Morning' or 'Good Evening' depending on the time of the day? This is achieved using control flow statements. There are three control flow statements in Python - `if`, `for` and `while`\n",

For example, `range(1, 5)` gives the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. By default, `range` take a step count of 1. If we supply a third number to `range`, then that becomes the step count. For example, `range(1, 5, 2)` gives `[1, 3]`. Remember that the range extends *up to* the second number, that is it does **not** include the second number.
