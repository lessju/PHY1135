    "Data structures are basically just that - they are structures which can hold some *data* together. In other words, they are used to store a collection of related data.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "A `list` is a data structure that holds an ordered collection of items i.e. you can store a *sequence* of items in a list. This is easy to imagine if you can think of a shopping list where you have a list of items to buy, except that you probably have each item on a separate line in your shopping list whereas in Python you put commas in between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The list of items should be enclosed in square brackets so that Python understands that you are specifying a list. Once you have created a list, you can add, remove or search for items in the list. Since we can add and remove items, we say that a list is a *mutable* data type i.e. this type can be altered."

    "First, we see how to use indexes to get individual items of a sequence. This is\n",
    "also referred to as the subscription operation. Whenever you specify a number\n",
    "to a sequence within square brackets as shown above, Python will fetch you the\n",
    "item corresponding to that position in the sequence. Remember that Python\n",
    "starts counting numbers from 0. Hence, `shoplist[0]` fetches the first item and\n",
    "`shoplist[3]` fetches the fourth item in the `shoplist` sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The index can also be a negative number, in which case, the position is calculated from the end of the sequence. Therefore, `shoplist[-1]` refers to the last item in the sequence and `shoplist[-2]` fetches the second last item in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The slicing operation is used by specifying the name of the sequence followed by\n",
    "an optional pair of numbers separated by a colon within square brackets. Note\n",
    "that this is very similar to the indexing operation you have been using till now. Remember the numbers are optional but the colon isn’t.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first number (before the colon) in the slicing operation refers to the position from where the slice starts and the second number (after the colon) indicates where the slice will stop at. If the first number is not specified, Python will start at the beginning of the sequence. If the second number is left out, Python will stop at the end of the sequence. Note that the slice returned starts at the start position and will end just before the end position i.e. the start position is included but the end position is excluded from the sequence slice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, `shoplist[1:3]` returns a slice of the sequence starting at position 1,\n",
    "includes position 2 but stops at position 3 and therefore a slice of two items is returned. Similarly, `shoplist[:]` returns a copy of the whole sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also do slicing with negative positions. Negative numbers are used for\n",
    "positions from the end of the sequence. For example, `shoplist[:-1]` will return\n",
    "a slice of the sequence which excludes the last item of the sequence but contains everything else.\n",
