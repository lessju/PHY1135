    "# Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will be using the Python programming language. Python \n",
    "is a great general-purpose programming language on its own, but with the help of a few popular libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib) it becomes a powerful environment for scientific computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Course overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The following lists the overview for this course:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 6 ECTS Credits\n",
    "- 50% Assignment, 50% Exam\n",
    "- Divided into 1hr lectures and 2hr lab sessions\n",
    "- Course material will be provided\n",
    "- For labs there is no need to buy any books, there are plenty of resources online\n",
    "- You are encouraged to bring your laptop with you and work on the course material in class\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any questions you can contact me on alessio.magro@um.edu.mt. You can also come to my office with any questions: Room 204, Maths and Physics building. It is advised to send an email to book a slot to make sure that I will be available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why bother to learn programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is becoming a necessity in most of the sciences. We'll stick to physical problems in this course. Traditional analytical tools have certain limitations, since although they have enabled us to solve an incredible range of problems, they are mostly restricted to linear systems. And the vast majority of outstanding problems are inherently non-linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, spurred by the rising cost of experimentation, computational physics is used to conduct \"experiments\" in the virtual world through simulations. Modern experiments and instruments also tend to generate a lot of data which cannot be processed by hand, so software is required to aid the scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational physics serves as a critical role at the interface between experimental and theoretical physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a computer?\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a computer? There are various definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A programmable machine that receives input, stores and manipulates data, and provides output in a useful format\n",
    "- a machine for performing calculations automatically\n",
    "- the most useful and most frustrating thing any human being will ever work with\n",
    "- a very, very expensive punching bag\n",
    "\n",
    "A definition more applicable to us:\n",
    "A set of devices which work **under the control of a stored program**, **automatically** accepting and **processing data** to produce information\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computers carry out instructions, a set of which is called a **program**. It tells the computer's control unit what to do\n",
    "- A program is written using a **computer** (or **programming**) **language**\n",
    "- **Software** is the general term to describe all the programs and data used in computer systems\n",
    "- **Hardware** is the collective term used to refer to the series of devices making up a computer\n",
    "- **Programming** is the art/science/magic of writing software. Programs are usually written as text files. **Code** is the textual representation of programs\n",
    "- A **compiler** transforms these text files into a form which the CPU can understand and **execute**\n",
    "- An **interpreter** does not transform the entire text files, but goes through your code line by line as it is being executed and only transforms the lines which are currently being executed\n",
    "- When a program behaves incorrectly, it is said to have a **bug**. **Debugging** is the act of removing bugs from a program\n",
    "\n",
    "For a high-level introduction of how computers work, have a look at [these slides](introduction_computer_systems.pptx)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "These will be available online (on VLE) as PDFs as well as Python notebooks which can be viewed online through [this link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lessju/phy1135/blob/master/index.ipynb). Note that there are plenty of other notebooks available for viewing here, so feel free to have a look around.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Python\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Python, we first need to install Python. We will be using Python version 3. We will also need to install several packages which we will be using along the way. This section will help you get your Python installation up and running.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make things easier, we will be using Anaconda to install Python and all the packages which we will need. You can install Anaconda from [here](http://www.anaconda.com/download). Intructions on how to install Anaconda on your systems are available [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Select the Python 3.8 version, 64-bit graphical installer. Leave all installation options as they are (simply press Next on each screen).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to check whether the installation succeeded on Windows, open up the command prompt (windows key + r, or type `cmd` in the seach bar), type in python and press enter. You sould be looking at something like the screenshot below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/python_cmd.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Online Python Interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "For simple programs and for testing out snippets in the notes you can use the online Python interpreter [Repl](https://repl.it/languages/Python3). Simply write your Python code on the left hand side and click on the 'Run' button. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Integrated Development Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using Spyder as our IDE (Integrated Developer Environment). This provides a User Interface in which we can develop our Python application, and provides a rich sets of utilities and features which makes Python development easy and fun. Spyder is installed by default with Anaconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open Spyder for the first time you should see a window similar to the below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/spyder.png\" width=\"800px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "On the left there is an editor open where you can write Python code. This is currently a temporary file. When writing new scripts you should create a new Python file by either pressing the New File button (first one) on the toolbar, or selcting File -> New File in the menu. A new file will be created. You will only be asked where you want your file to be saved when you save the file for the first time. You can run your code by pressing the \"Play\" button. \n",
